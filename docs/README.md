## Current Status

Project phase: analysis and planning complete, implementation not started.

As of 2026-02-22:

- v1 scope and acceptance criteria are defined.
- implementation sequencing is defined.
- handoff material for successor Codex sessions is defined.

## Read Order

1. `docs/notifications-skill-v1-acceptance-spec.md`
2. `docs/notifications-skill-v1-implementation-plan.md`
3. `docs/notifications-skill-v1-successor-handoff.md`

## What Exists vs Missing

Exists:

- acceptance criteria and behavior matrix
- sandbox and config constraints
- reference-backed architecture direction

Missing (next phase):

- actual skill implementation
- notify hook script implementation
- automated tests and test harness
- packaging/install workflow for external users

## Quick Resume Checklist

When resuming after context loss:

1. Re-read acceptance spec and confirm no product changes.
2. Re-validate docs truth on current Codex release if date has advanced materially.
3. Execute implementation plan phases in order.
4. Track progress in successor handoff checklist.
5. Run acceptance tests before any release claim.
