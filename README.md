# codexnotifications

Planning and implementation repository for a global Codex notifications skill.

Primary goal:

- provide `$notifications on` and `$notifications off` skill commands
- enable reliable completion notifications and approval-request notification coverage
- keep behavior graceful across macOS/Linux/Windows and common terminal setups

Start here:

- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/notifications-skill-v1-acceptance-spec.md`
